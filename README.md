#Installation
You are required first and foremost to download [The Composer](http://getcomposer.org/download). After you have downloaded and installed this plugin. all you have to do is run 'php composer.phar install --prefer-dist'
You will be then given one beautiful placed folder ```app``` this folder has two folders inside, the ```functions``` and the ```views``` the ```functions``` component will harbor all of your autoloaded class files (with / without) namespaces. While the ```views``` folder (you guessed it right) harbors all the template files generated by Twig. Yes, Awesome isn't it! We use twig! on Wordpress!
##Configurations
All configuration shall be manifested under ```app.php```. 
###Configuring the Options Page
Is it hard to create your own options page WITH elegance on wordpress? Now its autoloaded for you, all you have to do is open and edit ```app.php``` it houses a 'options'. These would hold the 4 required files.

If editing the files are too much of a burden, you open the ```functions/OptionsPage.php``` and edit it yourself. The Views component is autoloaded already under ```views/options/options.html.twig```.

#Calling The Views Component
We Have graciously wrapped Twig for you.
all you have to do is
```php
	echo View::factorize('options/options.html.twig')->load();
```

You may add parameters
```php
	echo View::factorize('options/options.html.twig')->load(['title'=>'Options Title', 'content'=>'content']);
```
#Asset Loading
Getting tedious and irritated with having to load alot of wp_enqueue_stlye or wp_enqueue_scripts? Now you don't have to all you have to do is load
```php
Asset::factorize('back','styles')->queue();  // for back end scripts 
//and
Asset::factorize('back','scripts')->queue(); // for back end styles
```
You are required two parameters ```loc``` and ```type``` consecutively, each will load separate config files depending on what you need. the following examples shall load ```config\back_styles_assets.php`` and ```config\back-scripts_assets.php```

the format you are required to have is <loc>_<type>_assets.php
#Adding more packages
You may add your own packages with the use of composer. After downloading the composer file you may easily autoload it with ```app.php``` just add your folder like so.
```php
	'libs'	=> array(
			'MyLib' 		=> base_path().'/../vendor/sourcescript/wf-core-framework/src', //add your own file
		),
```
